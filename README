Where Do You Go provides Foursquare users with a dynamic visualization of the places they have visited in New York and other cities. This data is overlaid as a dynamic layer on top of a standard Google Map interface. Users can also generate a snapshot of their map and share it as a static URL on their personal blog and other webpages, as well as create a simple WDYG wrapper page so they can share their image on Twitter. The image will self-update automatically in the background as users continue to use Foursquare and visit new places.

(Note that user privacy is protected because recent data is not shown and because individual check-ins are aggregated into an imprecise heat map.)


There are still a few slight changes I want to make to the code, and feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
